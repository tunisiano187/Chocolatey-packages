    <description><![CDATA[## WARP free cloudflare vpn
The free app that makes your Internet safer.

#### You’re one tap away from a safer Internet.
When the Internet was built, computers weren’t mobile. Those days are long gone—the assumptions made 30 years ago are now making your Internet experience slow and insecure.

1.1.1.1 with WARP replaces the connection between your device and the Internet with a modern, optimized, protocol.

#### Fast. Free. Private.
Your Internet service provider can see every site and app you use—even if they’re encrypted. Some providers even sell this data, or use it to target you with ads.

1.1.1.1 with WARP prevents anyone from snooping on you by encrypting more of the traffic leaving your device.

We believe privacy is a right. We won't sell your data, ever.

#### Use the Internet fast-lane
WARP+ extends WARP by sending all of your Internet traffic over the same optimized Internet routes which
make thousands of websites 30% faster on average. WARP+ combines millions of Internet route measurements
with Cloudflare’s private Internet backbone to deliver a better Internet directly to your device.

Existing WARP+ subscribers can add additional devices to their plan at a discount.

## System Requirements

√ Compatible with x64 versions of Windows 10 1909+.
