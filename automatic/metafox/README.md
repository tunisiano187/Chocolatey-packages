MetaFox is a **simple to use MKV video file converter** with a few steps. The installer places a shortcut on your desktop. You drag'n'drop a file or even an entire folder onto the shortcut and it will create copies of the originals in the MKV format. This tool is especially useful to Windows 7/10 users who have trouble with thumbnails or video playback. MetaFox converts HEVC, AVI, MOV, MP4, MPG, FLV, RMVB, etc... to MKV files efficiently with great picture quality. For those of you who don't know, MKV stands for "Matroska Video". Matroska is a container file format, capable of holding an unlimited number of video, audio and subtitile tracks, along with any metadata. Practically this means that it is possible to put entire movie with multiple sound and subtitle tracks, chapters information and movie thumbnail into single file. Being free Matroska gained broad support and quickly becomes de-facto standard for storing movies.

Metafox is free. However, the author does accept donations on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=A4SV4449UB4UQ&lc=DK&item_name=MetaFox&currency_code=USD).
