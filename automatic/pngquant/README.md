## pngquant
pngquant is a command-line conversion utility and library to quantize (lossy compression) and
dither truecolor PNG images, especially those with a full alpha channel, down to 8-bit (or smaller)
RGBA-palette PNGs. Such images are usually two to four times smaller than the full 32-bit versions, and
partial transparency is preserved quite nicely. This makes pngquant especially useful both for Web sites
and for PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is RGBA-palette-based (though not
PNG-compressed). This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous Transparent
PNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and the results are often indistinguishable from
the original, truecolor PNG images.
