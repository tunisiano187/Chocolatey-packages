    <description><![CDATA[## Redshift Tray
Redshift Tray (by ltGuillaume) is a no-frills GUI for the excellent screen 
temperature adjustment tool Redshift by Jon Lund Steffensen. 

### Features

* Quickly enable/disable Redshift: double-click the tray icon;
* Force a full nighttime temperature adjustment, no matter what the actual time is;
* Pause the temperature adjustment for x minutes;
* Adjust the screen brightness and forced temperature via hotkeys;
* Optionally update your current coordinates every time you enable Redshift (e.g. when traveling).

It also includes a set of optional [hotkeys](https://github.com/ltGuillaume/Redshift-Tray#list-of-hotkeys).

### Notes

* The compiled version of Redshift Tray (`rstray.exe`) offered by this package 
is completely free of viruses and other malware. Unfortunately, many pesky virus 
scanners mark compiled AutoHotkey scripts as infected (see [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Virus) and [here](https://github.com/ltGuillaume/Redshift-Tray/issues/15)). 
So please tell your antivirus software to back off and mind its own business, 
or - if you can - report the executable as safe.
