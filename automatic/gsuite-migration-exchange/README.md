##G Suite Migration for Microsoft® Exchange

You can migrate email, contacts, calendar, and Public Folder data from on-premise and hosted Microsoft® Exchange to G Suite, whether you have just a few users or tens of thousands. 

You can also migrate data from PST files and emails from IMAP servers (Novell® GroupWise®, Cyrus, Dovecot, Courier, SunMail, Zimbra and Gmail) using this tool. 

###Feature Overview

* Perform a centrally managed bulk migration of users
* Selectively migrate email, calendar or contacts (or any combination thereof)
* Migrate in phases for very large migrations	

You can also migrate mail, contacts and calendar events with the [Data migration service](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169) available in the G Suite Admin console. The Data migration service supports migrations from Microsoft® Exchange, Office 365, and IMAP-accessible mail servers such as GoDaddy or Yahoo. The Data migration service does not currently support migrating from PST files. 

###System Requirements

####Environment:
* G Suite, G Suite for Education, or G Suite for Government.
* Microsoft® Exchange 2000/2003/2007/2010 or an IMAP server (Novell® GroupWise®, Cyrus, Dovecot, Courier, SunMail, Zimbra, or Gmail).

####Machine to run the tool:
* Microsoft® Windows: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista Business SP1 or later, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2003 SP2 or later, Windows 2008, Windows 2008 R2.
* Microsoft Outlook® 2003/2007/2010/2013 (required only for migrating from Microsoft® Exchange or PST files). 64-bit versions and Click-to-Run versions are not supported.
