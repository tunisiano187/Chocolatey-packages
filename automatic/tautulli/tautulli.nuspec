## WHAT IS TAUTULLI?

verb | tau • tul • li | \ ˈtau̇-tü-lē \ | To watch or monitor

Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. The only thing missing is "why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.

### FEATURES:
* Monitoring - Monitor the current activity on your Plex Media Server.

* Statistics - View statistics about your Plex library.

* History - Log watch history for all your users.

* Graphs - View streaming trends with intuitive graphs.

* Notifications - Trigger notifications or scripts from activity on your server.

* Recently Added - Know when content is added to your Plex library.

* Sync - View all synced content from your server.

* Media Info - See detailed media info for all your content.

* Customizable - Many settings to make Tautulli work the way you want.

* Cross Platform - Works on any system that supports python.
